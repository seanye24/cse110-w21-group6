I am a second year Computer Science major from Warren college. I have been in San Diego all my life and love setting up bonfires on the La Jolla Shores. Apart from school, I have a passion for dancing and have joined various dance teams. I also enjoy filming/editing - on school breaks I venture out with some high school friends to national parks and capture the best moments on film!
