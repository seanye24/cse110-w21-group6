I am a 4th year Pharmacological Chemistry major with a minor in Computer Science at Sixth College. I was born and raised in San Diego. When I have time to relax, I love to watch movies, read articles, go on outdoor walks, and play video games (primarily on my PC and Nintendo Switch).

I am a second year Computer Science major from Warren college. I have been in San Diego all my life and love setting up bonfires on the La Jolla Shores. Apart from school, I have a passion for dancing and have joined various dance teams. I also enjoy filming/editing - on school breaks I venture out with some high school friends to national parks and capture the best moments on film!

I am a second year Computer Engineering major in Eleanor Roosevelt College.

I am a huge fan of going to new places with friends and meeting new people, so I'm really excited to be working on this project with my amazing teammates!
