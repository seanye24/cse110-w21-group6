# Should there be an extra list of tasks that have been completed?

* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Sijie Wang
* Date: February 21st, 2021 

## Context and Problem Statement

When a task is completed, where should it go? Should it disappear or be present for the user to see?

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Remove the task completely from the site
* Option 2: Move the task to a separate list that exists solely to hold completed tasks

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Remove task

* Good, because it increases the minimalistic aspects of the site
* Bad, because the user won't be able to look at the tasks they've completed

### Option 2: Move task to new list

* Good, because user will be able to track all of the tasks they've completed
* Bad, because it decreases the minimalistic aspects of the site

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 2 (Move Task), because it is far more important for the user to see all the tasks they've completed than maintaining a level of minimalism for the site.
